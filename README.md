## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS & SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- vanilla JS
- love &#10084;

### What I learned

I coded this challenge as a break from another one that is way complicated however I found adjusting images in this one quite difficult. I decided to add some link effects and spent some time to find a solution for the underline effect for the button "Learn more". I had a chance to work on SASS architecture one more time and try to accommodate SASS code into separate files. I coded my media queries as breakpoints in mixins which is new to me.

### Continued development

I want to five deeper into JS animations.
